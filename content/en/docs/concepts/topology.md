My cnc is wired to be a `YXZ-machine`

3-axis milling machines are build out of the following parts:

- Table
  - axis 1
    - axis 2
      - axis 3

There are two common types of 3-axis machines

## XYZ machines

- Table
  - X axis (on the table)
    - Y axis (gantry)
      - Z axis (moves spindle)

## YXZ machines

- Table
  - Y axis (on the table)
    - X axis (gantry)
      - Z axis (moves spindle)
